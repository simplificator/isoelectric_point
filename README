== isoelectric_point_4_R

A ruby class for calculating the isoelectric point of a protein

example
#takes two initialization arguments; a pkas set and an amino acid string
#The available pka sets are:
 #       dta_select_pkas
 #       emboss_pkas
 #       rodwell_pkas
   #     wikipedia_pkas
    #    sillero_pkas

#initialize a pka clculator object with dtaselect pkas and the KKGFTCGELA as an amino acid sequence
isoelectric_calc = Isoelectric_point.new("dtaselect","KKGFTCGELA")

#what is the protein charge at ph 14?
charge_at_ph_14 = isoelectric_calc.calculate_charge_at(14)

#calculate the ph and round off to 7 decimal places to increase precision
my_ph = isoelectric_calc.calculate_isoelectric_point(7)
